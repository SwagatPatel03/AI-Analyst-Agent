MODULE 1: AUTHENTICATION SERVICE
---------------------------------
File: backend/app/services/auth_service.py
Purpose: User authentication and authorization
Technologies: 
  • bcrypt (password hashing)
  • python-jose (JWT tokens)
  • SQLAlchemy (database ORM)

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
This module serves as the security backbone of the entire application, handling
all user authentication, authorization, and session management operations. It
implements industry-standard security practices including bcrypt password hashing
with salt rounds and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.

The service operates on a token-based authentication model where users receive
a JWT token upon successful login. This token contains encoded user information
and an expiration timestamp, and must be included in the Authorization header
of all subsequent API requests. The token is cryptographically signed using the
SECRET_KEY defined in environment variables, ensuring that tampering can be
detected.

Password security is paramount - all passwords are hashed using bcrypt with a
cost factor of 12, making them computationally expensive to crack. The original
password is never stored in the database, only the bcrypt hash. During login,
the service retrieves the hash from the database and uses bcrypt's verify
function to compare it with the provided password.

The module integrates deeply with FastAPI's dependency injection system, providing
a get_current_user dependency that can be used by any protected route to ensure
authentication and retrieve the authenticated user's information.

Functionality:
  ✓ User registration with email validation
  ✓ Secure password hashing (bcrypt with 12 rounds)
  ✓ JWT token generation with configurable expiration
  ✓ Token-based session management (stateless)
  ✓ Password verification with timing attack protection
  ✓ Current user retrieval from JWT token
  ✓ Email uniqueness validation
  ✓ Username uniqueness validation
  ✓ Account status checking (is_active flag)

Data Flow:
  Registration: 
    User Input (Email, Username, Password) → 
    Validate Email Format → 
    Check Email/Username Uniqueness → 
    Hash Password with bcrypt (12 rounds) → 
    Create User Record in Database → 
    Return User Object (without password hash)
  
  Login: 
    User Credentials (Username/Email, Password) → 
    Query Database for User → 
    Verify Password using bcrypt.verify() → 
    Generate JWT Token (includes user_id, exp timestamp) → 
    Sign Token with SECRET_KEY → 
    Return Access Token + Token Type
  
  Authorization: 
    Incoming Request with Authorization Header → 
    Extract Bearer Token → 
    Decode JWT using SECRET_KEY → 
    Verify Token Signature & Expiration → 
    Extract User ID from Token Payload → 
    Query Database for User → 
    Verify User is Active → 
    Return User Object to Route Handler

Security Features:
  • Bcrypt hashing with automatic salt generation
  • JWT tokens with HS256 algorithm
  • Token expiration (default 30 minutes)
  • Timing attack resistant password comparison
  • SQL injection prevention via SQLAlchemy ORM
  • No password exposure in API responses
  • Automatic token invalidation on expiration

Key Functions:
  • hash_password(password: str) → str
      Takes plain text password, generates bcrypt hash with salt
      
  • verify_password(plain_password: str, hashed_password: str) → bool
      Safely compares plain password with stored hash
      
  • create_access_token(data: dict, expires_delta: Optional[timedelta]) → str
      Generates JWT token with user data and expiration time
      
  • authenticate_user(db: Session, email: str, password: str) → User | None
      Validates credentials and returns user object if successful
      
  • get_current_user(db: Session, token: str) → User
      Dependency function that extracts and validates user from JWT token

Error Handling:
  • HTTPException 401: Invalid credentials, expired token, missing token
  • HTTPException 400: Invalid email format, duplicate email/username
  • HTTPException 403: Inactive user account
  • Database errors are logged and return 500 Internal Server Error

MODULE 2: PDF PROCESSOR SERVICE
--------------------------------
File: backend/app/services/pdf_processor.py
Purpose: Extract text from PDF documents
Technologies:
  • PyPDF2 (PDF parsing)
  • pdfplumber (advanced extraction)
  • Python file handling

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
The PDF Processor Service is the entry point for document analysis, responsible
for converting binary PDF files into machine-readable text that can be processed
by downstream AI services. This module handles the complex task of parsing PDF
structure, dealing with various PDF encodings, and extracting text while
maintaining reasonable formatting.

PDFs are notoriously difficult to parse due to their complex internal structure.
Unlike plain text files, PDFs store text as graphics instructions, meaning the
text needs to be "reconstructed" from drawing commands. This service uses a
two-library approach: PyPDF2 for standard text extraction and pdfplumber as a
fallback for more complex PDFs with tables, forms, or unusual layouts.

The service is designed to handle financial reports and 10-K filings, which can
be hundreds of pages long and contain a mix of text, tables, images, and charts.
It focuses on extracting textual content while ignoring images, headers, footers,
and other non-essential elements that don't contribute to financial analysis.

One key challenge is handling scanned PDFs (image-based PDFs). Currently, this
service extracts text from text-based PDFs only. For scanned documents, the
text extraction will return minimal or no content, which is then handled by
error checking in the upload route.

The extracted text is returned as a single large string, typically ranging from
50,000 to 500,000 characters for annual reports. This text is then passed to
the Data Extractor Service for AI-powered parsing and structuring.

Functionality:
  ✓ PDF file validation (magic number checking)
  ✓ Text extraction from all pages (sequential processing)
  ✓ Table detection and extraction (via pdfplumber)
  ✓ Layout preservation (paragraph breaks, spacing)
  ✓ Error handling for corrupted PDFs
  ✓ Multi-page processing with progress tracking
  ✓ Memory-efficient streaming (doesn't load entire PDF in RAM)
  ✓ Character encoding detection (UTF-8, Latin-1, etc.)
  ✓ Whitespace normalization (removes excessive spaces/newlines)
  ✓ Page number extraction (for reference)

Data Flow:
  PDF File Path → 
  Validate File Exists & Is PDF (check magic bytes %PDF) → 
  Open with PyPDF2.PdfReader() → 
  Iterate Through All Pages → 
  For Each Page: Extract Text via extractText() → 
  If Text Empty: Try pdfplumber as Fallback → 
  Concatenate All Page Texts → 
  Clean & Normalize Text (remove extra whitespace) → 
  Return Full Text String

Technical Details:
  • Uses PyPDF2's extractText() method for primary extraction
  • Falls back to pdfplumber.open() for complex layouts
  • Handles encrypted PDFs (asks for password if needed)
  • Processes pages sequentially to manage memory usage
  • Text encoding normalized to UTF-8
  • Handles PDFs up to 500MB in size (configurable)

Performance Characteristics:
  • Speed: ~2-5 pages per second (depends on complexity)
  • Memory: Streams pages, doesn't load full PDF in memory
  • Typical 100-page report: 30-60 seconds processing time
  • Large 500-page filing: 3-5 minutes processing time

Key Functions:
  • extract_text_from_pdf(file_path: str) → str
      Main extraction function, returns full document text
      Handles all pages sequentially, returns concatenated text
      Raises exception if file not found or not a valid PDF
      
  • validate_pdf(file_path: str) → bool
      Checks if file exists and has valid PDF structure
      Reads first 4 bytes to verify %PDF magic number
      Returns True if valid, False otherwise
      
  • extract_tables(file_path: str) → List[List[str]]
      Uses pdfplumber to detect and extract tabular data
      Returns list of tables, each table as 2D list of cells
      Used for financial statement extraction (optional feature)

Error Handling:
  • FileNotFoundError: PDF file path doesn't exist
  • PyPDF2.errors.PdfReadError: Corrupted or invalid PDF
  • UnicodeDecodeError: Character encoding issues (attempts Latin-1 fallback)
  • MemoryError: PDF too large to process (returns partial text)
  • PasswordRequiredException: PDF is encrypted without password

Limitations:
  • Cannot extract text from scanned PDFs (image-based)
  • Table extraction may be imperfect for complex layouts
  • Charts and images are ignored (text only)
  • Footnotes may be out of order (depends on PDF structure)
  • Headers/footers included in text (not filtered)

MODULE 3: DATA EXTRACTOR SERVICE
---------------------------------
File: backend/app/services/data_extractor.py
Purpose: AI-powered financial data extraction from text
Technologies:
  • Groq API (Llama 3.3 70B Versatile)
  • JSON parsing
  • Custom prompt engineering

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
The Data Extractor Service is the intelligence core of the document processing
pipeline. It takes raw, unstructured text extracted from PDF documents and
transforms it into structured, machine-readable JSON data using advanced Large
Language Models (LLMs). This service represents the bridge between human-readable
financial reports and computer-analyzable data structures.

This module employs Groq's Llama 3.3 70B Versatile model, which is specifically
chosen for its:
  • Strong reasoning capabilities for financial document understanding
  • Large context window (128K tokens) for processing lengthy reports
  • Fast inference speed (350+ tokens/second on Groq infrastructure)
  • High accuracy in numerical data extraction
  • Ability to understand financial terminology and concepts

The extraction process uses sophisticated prompt engineering techniques to guide
the LLM in extracting specific financial data points with high accuracy. The
prompts are designed to:
  1. Identify key financial statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow)
  2. Extract specific line items (revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities, etc.)
  3. Capture temporal data (current year, previous years, growth rates)
  4. Extract qualitative insights (management discussion, risk factors)
  5. Identify business segments and geographic breakdowns
  6. Calculate derived metrics (ratios, margins, per-share values)

One of the key challenges is handling documents that exceed the model's context
window. Annual reports can contain 100,000+ words, which would exceed even the
128K token limit. The service solves this through intelligent chunking:
  • Text is split into ~40,000 character chunks (approximately 10K tokens)
  • Each chunk is processed independently
  • Results are merged using a sophisticated algorithm that prioritizes
    completeness and resolves conflicts
  • Critical sections (financial statements) are prioritized in early chunks

The extraction is structured around a comprehensive JSON schema that captures:
  • Company Metadata (name, year, fiscal period, currency, auditor)
  • Income Statement (10+ line items)
  • Balance Sheet (15+ line items)
  • Cash Flow Statement (3 sections, 10+ line items)
  • Key Financial Ratios (20+ ratios)
  • Business Segments (revenue, profit by segment)
  • Geographic Data (revenue by region)
  • Management Discussion & Analysis (text summaries)
  • Risk Factors (categorized risks)
  • Shareholder Information (dividends, buybacks, outstanding shares)

Functionality:
  ✓ Comprehensive financial data extraction (50+ data points)
  ✓ Multi-chunk processing for large documents (40K char chunks)
  ✓ Structured JSON output with defined schema
  ✓ Confidence scoring for each extracted value
  ✓ Provenance tracking (which page/section data came from)
  ✓ Automatic unit normalization (thousands, millions, billions)
  ✓ Currency detection and conversion tracking
  ✓ Multi-year data extraction (3-5 years of history)
  ✓ Derived metric calculation (ratios, percentages)
  ✓ Error detection and flagging (missing data, inconsistencies)
  ✓ Retry logic with exponential backoff (API failures)
  ✓ Fallback to alternative extraction strategies

Data Flow:
  Raw Text (50K-500K characters) → 
  Analyze Length & Complexity → 
  Split into Optimal Chunks (40K chars each) → 
  For Each Chunk:
    Build Extraction Prompt (1500 tokens) → 
    Call Groq API (Llama 3.3 70B) → 
    Parse JSON Response → 
    Validate Structure → 
    Extract Confidence Scores → 
  Merge Chunk Results (conflict resolution) →

MODULE 4: DATA VALIDATOR SERVICE
---------------------------------
File: backend/app/services/data_validator.py
Purpose: Validate and clean extracted financial data
Technologies:
  • Python typing
  • Pydantic models
  • Custom validation rules

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
The Data Validator Service acts as a quality control checkpoint in the data
processing pipeline. After the AI extracts financial data from documents, this
service rigorously validates the data to ensure accuracy, completeness, and
logical consistency before it's stored in the database or used for analysis.

Financial data validation is critical because downstream processes (ML predictions,
visualizations, report generation) rely on accurate, well-formed data. A single
incorrect or missing value can cascade into faulty predictions or misleading
reports. This service implements multiple layers of validation:

1. Schema Validation: Ensures the JSON structure matches expected format
2. Type Validation: Verifies data types (numbers are numbers, strings are strings)
3. Range Validation: Checks values are within realistic bounds
4. Relationship Validation: Verifies mathematical relationships (e.g., assets = liabilities + equity)
5. Business Logic Validation: Applies financial domain knowledge (e.g., profit margin should be -100% to 100%)
6. Completeness Validation: Checks for required fields and flags missing data

The service uses Pydantic models to define expected data structures. Pydantic
provides automatic type coercion (string "100" → integer 100), validation error
messages, and JSON serialization. Each financial data category (Income Statement,
Balance Sheet, etc.) has its own Pydantic model with field-level validators.

When validation errors occur, the service doesn't just reject the data. Instead,
it generates a detailed validation report that:
  • Lists all errors with specific field names and error descriptions
  • Categorizes errors by severity (critical, warning, info)
  • Suggests fixes where possible
  • Provides a overall quality score (0-100)
  • Allows partial acceptance (store valid data, flag invalid fields)

The cleaning process includes:
  • Removing extra whitespace from strings
  • Normalizing number formats (removing commas, converting units)
  • Standardizing date formats
  • Converting percentages to decimals (or vice versa)
  • Filling missing values with reasonable defaults (null, 0, or N/A)
  • Rounding numbers to appropriate precision

Functionality:
  ✓ Schema validation using Pydantic models
  ✓ Data type checking and coercion
  ✓ Range validation (positive values for revenue, assets, etc.)
  ✓ Relationship validation (financial equation checking)
  ✓ Required field checking (critical vs optional fields)
  ✓ Error reporting with severity levels
  ✓ Data cleaning and normalization
  ✓ Unit conversion verification
  ✓ Outlier detection (statistical methods)
  ✓ Cross-field consistency checks
  ✓ Historical comparison (current vs previous year)
  ✓ Quality scoring (overall data quality metric)

Data Flow:
  Raw JSON from AI Extractor → 
  Parse JSON Structure → 
  Schema Validation (Pydantic) → 
  Type Checking & Coercion → 
  Range Validation (field by field) → 
  Business Rule Validation:
    • Check Revenue > 0
    • Check Assets = Liabilities + Equity (±5% tolerance)
    • Check Profit Margin within -100% to 100%
    • Check Current Ratio > 0
    • Check Debt-to-Equity ≥ 0
    • Verify percentage fields 0-100
    • Verify year is 1900-2100
  → 
  Clean & Normalize Data:
    • Trim whitespace
    • Convert units (millions/billions)
    • Format dates (YYYY-MM-DD)
    • Round numbers (2 decimal places)
  → 
  Generate Validation Report:
    • List errors (critical, warnings, info)
    • Calculate quality score
    • Flag missing fields
  → 
  Return Validated Data + Report

Validation Rules (Detailed):

Financial Relationships:
  • Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Shareholders Equity (±5% tolerance)
  • Current Assets + Non-Current Assets = Total Assets
  • Current Liabilities + Long-Term Liabilities = Total Liabilities
  • Gross Profit = Revenue - Cost of Revenue
  • Operating Income = Gross Profit - Operating Expenses
  • Net Income ≈ Operating Income - Interest - Taxes
  • Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures

Range Validations:

MODULE 5: EXCEL GENERATOR SERVICE (V2)
---------------------------------------
File: backend/app/services/excel_generator_v2.py
Purpose: Generate comprehensive Excel workbooks from financial data
Technologies:
  • openpyxl (Excel generation)
  • Python formatting
  • Multi-sheet workbooks

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
The Excel Generator Service transforms structured financial JSON data into
professionally formatted Excel workbooks that can be used for further analysis,
presentations, or archival purposes. This service is the "V2" version, representing
a complete rewrite from the original version with enhanced formatting, additional
sheets, and improved data organization.

Excel remains the universal language of business and finance. While our application
provides web-based visualizations and AI-powered analysis, many users need to
export data to Excel for:
  • Integration with existing financial models
  • Custom pivot tables and analysis
  • Sharing with stakeholders who prefer Excel
  • Archival and compliance requirements
  • Offline access to financial data

The service generates multi-sheet workbooks with 7-10 sheets, each focused on
a specific aspect of financial analysis. Each sheet is professionally formatted
with:
  • Company branding (colors, headers)
  • Clear section headers with bold fonts
  • Alternating row colors for readability
  • Number formatting (currency, percentages, thousands separator)
  • Borders and gridlines
  • Freeze panes for header rows
  • Column auto-sizing
  • Conditional formatting (red for negative, green for positive)
  • Data validation where appropriate
  • Formula cells (for calculated values)
  • Charts and sparklines (inline mini-charts)

The Excel files are generated using the openpyxl library, which provides full
control over cell formatting, formulas, charts, and workbook structure. Unlike
pandas' to_excel() which produces plain tables, openpyxl allows for magazine-
quality formatting that matches professional financial reports.

One key design decision: the Excel file contains both raw data AND calculated
values. This allows users to:
  1. See the analysis results immediately (no formulas needed)
  2. Modify data and recalculate using Excel formulas
  3. Build custom formulas referencing our data
  4. Create custom charts and pivot tables

  ✓ Data validation (dropdowns, ranges)
  ✓ Conditional formatting (color scales, data bars)
  ✓ Number formatting (currency, percentages, accounting format)
  ✓ Formula cells (SUM, AVERAGE, growth calculations)
  ✓ Freeze panes (keep headers visible)
  ✓ Column auto-sizing (fit content)
  ✓ Multiple years comparison (side-by-side columns)

MODULE 7: ML PREDICTOR SERVICE (ENHANCED)
------------------------------------------
File: backend/app/services/ml_predictor_enhanced.py
Purpose: Generate machine learning predictions for financial forecasting
Technologies:
  • scikit-learn (ML models)
  • numpy (numerical computing)
  • pandas (data manipulation)
  • Ensemble methods

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
The ML Predictor Service is the predictive analytics engine of the application,
leveraging machine learning algorithms to forecast future financial performance,
assess risks, and generate actionable investment insights. This is the "Enhanced"
version, featuring ensemble models, advanced risk metrics, and scenario analysis.

Financial forecasting is inherently uncertain, but ML models can identify patterns
in historical data that inform probabilistic predictions. This service takes a
multi-model ensemble approach, combining several algorithms to produce more robust
and reliable predictions than any single model could provide.

The service is designed to work with limited data (often just 2-3 years of history
from a single report). While this is less data than ideal for ML, the service:
  1. Uses feature engineering to extract maximum signal from available data
  2. Applies domain knowledge (financial relationships) to guide predictions
  3. Provides wide confidence intervals to reflect uncertainty
  4. Combines ML predictions with rule-based heuristics
  5. Benchmarks against industry averages

Key innovations:
  • Ensemble approach: Combines 5 different ML models
  • Confidence intervals: Every prediction includes upper/lower bounds
  • Risk-adjusted forecasts: Considers volatility and downside risk
  • Scenario analysis: Best/worst/base case projections
  • Anomaly detection: Flags unusual patterns that might invalidate predictions
  • Industry context: Compares predictions to sector benchmarks

The predictions are not meant to be "crystal ball" accurate. Instead, they provide:
  • Reasonable baseline expectations (most likely outcome)
  • Range of possible outcomes (confidence intervals)
  • Risk assessment (how uncertain is the forecast?)
  • Comparative context (vs. industry peers)
  • Investment implications (buy/hold/sell signals)

Functionality:
  ✓ Revenue forecasting (3-5 years ahead)
  ✓ Growth rate prediction (with confidence intervals)
  ✓ Profitability forecasting (net income, margins)
  ✓ Risk assessment (Value at Risk, volatility, beta)
  ✓ Scenario analysis (optimistic/base/pessimistic cases)
  ✓ Industry comparison (vs. sector averages)
  ✓ Anomaly detection (unusual patterns flagging)
  ✓ Investment scoring (0-100 buy/sell indicator)
  ✓ Trend analysis (momentum, mean reversion)
  ✓ Feature importance (what drives predictions?)
  ✓ Model confidence scores (how reliable are predictions?)
  ✓ Sensitivity analysis (what-if scenarios)

    • Historical volatility (stdev of growth rates)
    • Value at Risk 95% (worst-case in 19 out of 20 scenarios)
    • Downside risk (probability of negative growth)
    • Beta (vs. market/industry)
    • Sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted returns)
  →
  Scenario Generation:
    • Base Case: Ensemble prediction (50th percentile)
    • Optimistic: 75th percentile of confidence interval
    • Pessimistic: 25th percentile

    • Compare margins: company vs. peers
    • Calculate relative valuation
    • Generate positioning (leader/average/laggard)
  →
  Investment Scoring:
    • Base score: 50
    • Adjust for growth rate (+20 if >15% growth)
    • Adjust for profitability (+15 if ROE >20%)
    • Adjust for risk (-10 if high volatility)
    • Adjust for trend (+10 if improving margins)

Feature Engineering:
  From raw financial data, creates 20+ features:
  • growth_rate = (current - previous) / previous
  • revenue_lag1, revenue_lag2 (previous years)
  • margin_trend = current_margin - previous_margin
  • asset_growth = (current_assets - previous_assets) / previous_assets
  • roe_trend = current_roe - previous_roe
  • leverage_change = current_de_ratio - previous_de_ratio
  • cash_flow_to_revenue = cash_flow / revenue
  • normalized_revenue = (revenue - mean) / std
  • And more...

Model Training (if sufficient data):
  • Requires minimum 3 data points (years)
  • Ideal: 5+ years of history
  • Uses time series cross-validation
  • Prevents data leakage (no future info in training)
  • Regularization to prevent overfitting
  • Early stopping for iterative models

Confidence Intervals:
  • Calculated using prediction standard error
  • Accounts for model uncertainty + data variability
  • Wider intervals for further-out predictions
  • Ensemble models have narrower intervals (more confidence)
  • 95% confidence: 95% probability true value falls within interval

Error Handling:
  • Insufficient data: Falls back to simple linear extrapolation
  • Missing values: Imputes using forward fill or median
  • Outliers: Winsorizes extreme values (caps at 5th/95th percentile)
  • Model training failure: Uses fallback models
  • Negative predictions: Floors at zero (revenue can't be negative)

Limitations & Disclaimers:
  • Predictions are probabilistic, not certain
  • Based on historical patterns (past ≠ future)
  • Doesn't account for black swan events
  • Quality depends on input data quality
  • Short history (2-3 years) → wide confidence intervals
  • Should be combined with fundamental analysis
  • Not financial advice (informational only)

MODULE 10: REPORT GENERATOR SERVICE
------------------------------------
File: backend/app/services/report_generator.py
Purpose: Generate comprehensive financial analysis reports
Technologies:
  • Google Gemini AI (2.0 Flash)
  • Markdown generation
  • HTML conversion
  • PDF generation

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
The Report Generator Service is the culmination of the entire analysis pipeline,
transforming raw financial data and ML predictions into professional, human-readable
analyst reports. This service leverages Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model to produce
comprehensive financial analysis reports that rival those written by professional
analysts.

This module represents a strategic decision to use AI for report generation rather
than templates. While templates can produce consistent reports, they lack the
nuance, context-awareness, and analytical depth that AI can provide. Gemini 2.0
Flash was chosen for several reasons:
  • Superior writing quality (natural, professional prose)
  • Strong financial domain knowledge (trained on analyst reports)
  • Fast generation speed (30-60 seconds for 2000-word report)
  • Large context window (1M tokens - can process all financial data)
  • Multi-format output (Markdown, which converts well to HTML/PDF)
  • Cost-effective ($0.10-0.30 per report)

The service works by constructing a comprehensive prompt that includes:
  1. Report requirements and structure (sections, length, tone)
  2. Complete financial data (all extracted metrics)
  3. ML predictions (forecasts, risks, scenarios)
  4. Context and guidelines (avoid hallucination, cite numbers)
  5. Output format specifications (Markdown with specific structure)

The AI then generates a 1500-2500 word report structured like a professional
analyst's report, with:
  • Executive Summary (key takeaways, investment thesis)
  • Financial Performance Analysis (deep dive into statements)
  • Key Metrics Interpretation (ratios, trends, comparisons)
  • Future Outlook (growth predictions, scenarios)
  • Risk Assessment (volatility, downside risks, qualitative risks)
  • Investment Recommendation (buy/hold/sell with rationale)
  • Conclusion (summary and final thoughts)

The generated report is initially in Markdown format (easy to parse, version
control friendly, human-readable). The service then converts it to:
  • HTML (for web display, with embedded visualizations)
  • PDF (for download, sharing, archival)

Functionality:
  ✓ AI-powered report writing (Gemini 2.0 Flash)
  ✓ Multi-format output (Markdown, HTML, PDF)
  ✓ Professional formatting and structure
  ✓ Data-driven insights (no hallucination)
  ✓ Visualization embedding (charts in HTML/PDF)
  ✓ Executive summary generation (2-3 paragraphs)
  ✓ Investment thesis development
  ✓ Risk factor analysis
  ✓ Scenario-based forecasting discussion
  ✓ Industry context integration
  ✓ Customizable report templates
  ✓ Retry logic (if generation fails)
  ✓ Fallback templates (if AI unavailable)
  ✓ Quality checks (length, structure, completeness)

Data Flow:
  Request Report for Report ID →
  Load Financial Data from Database (extracted_data JSON) →
  Load ML Predictions from Database (predictions JSON) →
  Load Company Metadata (name, year, industry) →
